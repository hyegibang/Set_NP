# Set_NP


#### The game of set consists of a deck of 81 unique cards. Each card has a different combination of one of the three shapes (oval, squiggle, diamond), one of three shadings (solid, striped, open), one of three colors (red, green, purple), and either one two or three of that specific combination printed on the card.

#### This NP Set Solver takes in a board state of set cards and determines if it is possible to clear the table.
