# Set_NP


#### The game of set consists of a deck of 81 unique cards. Each card has a different combination of one of the three shapes (oval, squiggle, diamond), one of three shadings (solid, striped, open), one of three colors (red, green, purple), and either one two or three of that specific combination printed on the card.

#### This NP Set Solver takes in a board state of set cards and determines if it is possible to clear the table. 

#### Check out our [description](https://github.com/hyegibang/Set_NP/blob/master/SetDescription.pdf) and [NP Proof](https://github.com/hyegibang/Set_NP/blob/master/Proof.pdf) for more details.

#### Our program files are in Python. All tests can be run with the following command (with any test file name inserted):

```python
Solver.py Tests/test6.txt
```

#### All test files can be found [here](https://github.com/hyegibang/Set_NP/tree/master/Tests). If you do not specify a test file it will default to random.

#### Check out the [example outputs](https://github.com/hyegibang/Set_NP/tree/master/Output%20Examples) to see what should be running.
